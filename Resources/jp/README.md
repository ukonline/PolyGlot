# Japanese

This repository contains resources to learn Japanese for French speaking people. For now, it only contains a set of sheets with vocabulary organised around specific given themes. Pronunciation clues are provided following the [HepBurn romanisation system](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hepburn_romanization), which is quite popular and well suited for Western speakers.

## Thematic Sheets

Seven thematics sheets are currently available:

- Close members of another family
- Counting from 1 to 10
- Counting from 11 to 100
- Day of the week
- Personal pronoun
- Saying goodbye
- Saying hello

To compile the `.tex` files to PDF files, you have to use the XeLaTeX compiler. For example:

    xelatex counting-1-10.tex
