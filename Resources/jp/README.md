# Japanese

This repository contains resources to learn Japanese for French speaking people. For now, it only contains a set of sheets with vocabulary organised around specific given themes. Pronunciation clues are provided following the [HepBurn romanisation system](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hepburn_romanization), which is quite popular and well suited for Western speakers.
